The substrate inverts the conventional editorial cycle. Most
publishing pipelines put the human Creative at the start of the
loop — drafts the manuscript, hands to copy-editor, ships to
readers. Foundry's substrate puts the Creative at the END of the
loop. Cluster Tasks ship rough drafts forward to a single editorial
gateway; the gateway refines to register; the refined version goes
live; Creative Contributors edit the published file; their edits
feed the next training cycle as preference data. This is the
inversion that lets a small Creative team scale to a substrate the
size of Wikipedia.

## Definition

The Reverse-Funnel Editorial Pattern is a publishing discipline
where:

1. Multiple originating clusters produce **bulk drafts** —
   technically accurate, freely-cited, rough register.
2. A single editorial gateway (`service-language`, the
   project-language cluster) refines every draft to production
   register: banned-vocabulary enforcement, BCSC continuous-
   disclosure posture, bilingual pair generation, citation registry
   resolution.
3. Refined version publishes immediately to the destination repo.
4. Creative Contributors enter at the **end** — they edit the
   published file. Their edits become the second leg of a
   preference pair.
5. Quarterly continued pretraining on the corpus of (raw → refined
   → creative-edited) tuples produces a substrate baseline that
   drifts closer to (refined ⊕ Creative) over time.

The pattern is the inverse of standard editorial workflow.
Standard: human writes, machine assists. Reverse-funnel: machine
drafts, human refines, both signals train the substrate.

## How the substrate operates

The substrate runs three input ports:

- Cluster Task drafts at `~/Foundry/clones/<cluster>/.claude/drafts-outbound/`
- Root drafts at `<repo>/.claude/drafts-outbound/`
- Master drafts at `~/Foundry/.claude/drafts-outbound/`

`bin/draft-sweep.sh` walks all three at session start;
project-language picks up `state: draft-pending-language-pass`
items in priority order. Each draft carries `foundry-draft-v1`
frontmatter declaring originating cluster, target repo, audience,
BCSC class, language protocol, and `notes_for_editor`. The draft
body is bulk — references inline as URLs, repetition allowed,
register discipline NOT enforced. project-language enforces.

Refinement applies four disciplines deterministically:

1. **Banned-vocabulary grammar** — Lark EBNF declares forbidden
   editorial terms; `validate.py` (Phase 1B) and decode-time
   enforcement via `[llguidance]` (AS-2 pending) make violations
   grammatically impossible.
2. **BCSC continuous-disclosure posture** — forward-looking claims
   carry planned / intended / may language, cautionary framing, and
   reasonable-basis blocks per `[ni-51-102]`.
3. **Citation registry resolution** — inline URLs in the bulk
   become `[citation-id]` references resolved against
   `~/Foundry/citations.yaml`.
4. **Bilingual pair generation** — Spanish strategic adaptation
   per DOCTRINE.md §XII (overview, not 1:1 translation).

Refined output hands off to the destination repo via the standard
`handoffs-outbound.md` mechanism. Three JSONL events emit to the
apprenticeship corpus: `draft-created` (originator),
`draft-refined` (project-language), `creative-edited` (originator
after publish + Creative edit).

## Why hyperscaler-managed AI cannot replicate

Three structural reasons.

**1. Per-tenant SLM continued-pretraining is structurally absent.**
Multi-tenant SaaS LLMs run a single editorial regime across all
customers. A Creative's edits in one tenant cannot feed an SLM
that personalises responses for that tenant only — the model is
shared. The Reverse-Funnel pattern's compounding loop closes only
when the SLM has tenant-private adapters and tenant-private
training corpus.

**2. Per-tenant editorial-floor adapters are structurally absent.**
Banned-vocabulary grammars, BCSC discipline templates,
language-protocol adapters are tenant-specific. Hyperscaler
products expose neither grammar composition nor adapter
composition primitives. Tenants get OpenAI's JSON-mode or
Anthropic's structured-output, not "here is your tenant's grammar
that loads at inference time."

**3. The closed loop demands tenant-sovereign training data.**
Even if a hyperscaler captured Creative edits, the resulting
training data feeds a tenant-neutral or vendor-specific model.
Tenants cannot own a model that becomes literate in their own
voice. The compounding loop demands the
`[constitutional-ai-2212-08073]`-style training-data sovereignty
that the multi-tenant LLM business model structurally cannot grant.

## What this enables in Foundry

The Compounding Substrate's editorial path closes a continued-
pretraining loop on craft, not just structure:

- The apprenticeship-substrate (Doctrine claim #32) closes the
  loop on **structural correctness** — apprentice diff → senior
  verdict → Stage-1 DPO pair.
- The Reverse-Funnel pattern closes the loop on **editorial craft**
  — refined draft → creative-edited → Stage-2 DPO pair.
- Both stages feed the same OLMo `[olmo3-allenai]` continued-
  pretraining corpus.

After enough cycles, the substrate produces draft baselines at
80% → 90% → 95% of Creative's craft level. Creative load drops
monotonically; their leverage grows. They move upstream to brand
strategy, architectural framing, novel-form authorship — work the
substrate cannot reach yet.

## Three-Tier Contributor Model — explicit mapping

The Three-Tier Contributor Model (Core / Paid / Open) maps onto
the cycle position:

- **Core** (4-7 operators): operate the substrate; cluster Tasks;
  doctrine; throughout the cycle
- **Paid** (50-100 Creative Contributors): edit the published
  refined version at the END of the cycle; craft + brand + voice
- **Open** (10K+ wiki consumers): consume + cite + fork outside
  the cycle

Paid contributors in this pattern are not tech writers. They are
craft specialists — designers, narrative editors, brand voice
contributors. The job description optimises for taste, not
synthesis.

## Forward-looking — pending substrate work

Per `[ni-51-102]` continuous-disclosure language, the trajectory
below is `planned` and `intended`:

- AS-2 (project-slm Task) integrates `[llguidance]` into the
  Doorman so vLLM Tier B accepts `extra_body.structured_outputs.grammar`.
  service-language is the primary consumer.
- Per-tenant Creative-voice adapters distill from accumulated
  Stage-2 DPO pairs over the first year of operation.
- The Stage-1 + Stage-2 OLMo continued-pretraining run targets
  quarterly cadence.
- Creative-tier hiring kicks off after the first batch of refined
  TOPICs publishes; the first cycles are operator-edited as
  bootstrapping data.
