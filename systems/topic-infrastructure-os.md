**Infrastructure OS** is the virtualization and networking backbone of the PointSav ecosystem. It operates as the foundational host layer that permits the execution of multiple isolated {{gli|Totebox Archive}} instances on a single physical or virtual machine.

## Virtualization and Orchestration

The primary role of **Infrastructure OS** is to virtualize hardware resources for the PointSav substrate. It acts as the underlying host for the **Micro Virtual Machines** that run individual Toteboxes. 

Through its integration with [[topic-totebox-orchestration]], Infrastructure OS manages the lifecycle of these archives, ensuring they remain isolated at the kernel level while providing the necessary compute resources for their internal services (such as extraction, indexing, and search).

## PointSav Private Network

Infrastructure OS creates and maintains the **PointSav Private Network**. This is an encrypted, peer-to-peer overlay network that permits secure communication between distributed PointSav appliances. 

Every node running Infrastructure OS becomes a verified member of this network, allowing for:
*   **Encrypted Data Transfer:** Moving {{gli|Totebox Archive}} bootable images between locations safely.
*   **Linguistic Signaling:** Coordinating task execution across clusters without exposing raw data to the public internet.
*   **Remote Administration:** Enabling secure access via [[topic-console-os]].

## Hybrid Deployment

Infrastructure OS is designed for **Hybrid Deployment**. It can boot directly on {{gli|Bare metal resources}} for maximum performance and security on-premise, or it can be deployed on public cloud resources (such as GCP, AWS, or Azure) to provide scalable infrastructure while maintaining the same sovereign security protocols.
