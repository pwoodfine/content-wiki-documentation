# Totebox Orchestration

**Totebox Orchestration** is the layer responsible for provisioning, coordinating, and monitoring individual Totebox instances in a PointSav deployment. A Totebox is an isolated data {{gli|container}} that separates active software engines from passive corporate ledgers. The {{gli|container}} stores data as inert flat files; cryptographic checksums verify structural integrity on a permanent basis.

When a customer operates more than one Totebox — for example, separate archive containers for contracts, financial records, and correspondence — the orchestration layer ensures each {{gli|container}} maintains its own isolated ledger, runs its own integrity verification pass, and reports health status through a unified monitoring surface.

## {{gli|Container}} isolation

Each Totebox runs as an independent unit. No {{gli|container}} shares a ledger directory with any other {{gli|container}}. A compromise in one {{gli|container}}'s asset directory does not propagate to sibling containers, because there is no shared mutable state at the ledger layer.

## Integrity verification

The orchestration layer schedules periodic checksum audits across all managed containers. Results are written to a consolidated audit record. Any checksum mismatch raises a flag at the orchestration level before surfacing to the operator.

## Provisioning and lifecycle

A new Totebox {{gli|container}} is provisioned with a three-directory skeleton — `app-console-input/`, `assets/`, and `ledger/` — and registered with the orchestration layer at creation time. The orchestration layer tracks {{gli|container}} state across its operational lifecycle: active, suspended, or archived.
