**MediaKit OS** is the specialized toolkit within the PointSav platform dedicated to the management, curation, and distribution of institutional media assets and knowledge. It consolidates a suite of refined Open Source tools into a unified execution environment.

## Content and Knowledge Management

The primary function of **MediaKit OS** is to power the platform's documentation engines (such as `app-mediakit-knowledge`). It provides the necessary libraries and protocols for:
*   **Markdown Parsing:** Rendering the Wikipedia-style documentation from flat files.
*   **Design Token Ingestion:** Applying structural UI rules from [[topic-wikipedia-layout]] and the [[pointsav-design-system]].
*   **Media Optimization:** Managing the PointSav and Woodfine logo assets and diagrams found in the [[pointsav-media-assets]] repositories.

## Unified Protocols

MediaKit OS enforces a set of **Unified Protocols** across the ecosystem. This ensures that every piece of media or documentation adheres to the same institutional standard, regardless of which cluster authored it. 

Key protocols include:
*   **Linguistic Tokens:** Standardizing the "Bloomberg-grade" tone and industry-validated terminology.
*   **Metadata Schemas:** Utilizing `foundry-doc-v1` and other structured frontmatter for all knowledge artifacts.
*   **Integrity Checks:** Verifying the cryptographic anchors of media assets stored within a {{gli|Totebox Archive}}.

## Integration with Totebox

MediaKit OS is natively integrated into the [[topic-totebox-orchestration]] layer. It typically runs as a service within a specialized **MediaKit Archive**, allowing it to read raw assets from the `assets/` directory and write refined documentation or public-facing websites directly to the `ledger/`.

This architecture ensures that the "muscle memory" of the platform's interface remains consistent and reliable across decades of operation.
