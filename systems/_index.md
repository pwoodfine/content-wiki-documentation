## Systems

This category covers the operating systems at the foundation layer of the PointSav platform. Each article describes one OS: its capability model, its role in tenant isolation, and how it composes with the services and applications that run on top of it.

The primary operating system is ToteboxOS — a formally verified capability-based OS built on seL4. Its design provides the tenant-isolation and cryptographic-attestation properties that the rest of the platform depends on. A second OS, the workplace operating environment, handles the employee-facing application surface. The orchestration layer connects them. Articles in this category are technical in register; readers should be comfortable with OS-level concepts, capability-based security, and hardware-level trust models.

## Articles in this category

- [[topic-os-totebox]] — ToteboxOS: the seL4-based capability OS at the platform's foundation layer; formal verification, capability model, and tenant isolation.
- [[topic-totebox-orchestration]] — How ToteboxOS instances are orchestrated across a fleet deployment; scheduling, isolation boundaries, and upgrade paths.

<!-- EDITORIAL NOTE: PL.7 chunked normalization sweep will migrate
     root-prefixed TOPICs into this category subdirectory. Until
     migration lands, the existing root TOPICs render at their current
     URLs (topic-<slug>.md); this landing references them by current slug. -->
