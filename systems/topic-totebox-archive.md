A **Totebox Archive** is the fundamental unit of data storage and sovereignty within the PointSav platform. It operates as a **Micro Virtual Machine** that provides self-contained services for specific institutional assets.

## Immutable Data Layer

Unlike traditional databases that require active processes to access data, a Totebox Archive persists information as **immutable flat files** (JSONL, GeoParquet, Markdown). This decoupling ensures that the data remains accessible and readable even if the original software engine is no longer running.

Each archive is cryptographically anchored to a {{gli|WORM ledger}}, creating a permanent, verifiable {{gli|Audit trail}} for all transactions and state changes.

## Freely Transferable System

A key architectural requirement of the PointSav system is that data must be an asset, not a liability. A Totebox Archive is designed to be **Freely Transferable**. It is packaged as a **Bootable Disk Image** that can be moved between physical servers, private clouds, or bare metal resources without losing its integrity or historical context.

## Asset Specialization

Totebox Archives are typically deployed as specialized containers for distinct institutional domains. Common archive types seen in the `cluster-totebox-jennifer` deployment include:

*   **Totebox Archive - Personnel:** Encrypted records and identification.
*   **Totebox Archive - Corporate:** Tax identification, formation documents, and minutes.
*   **Totebox Archive - Property:** Land titles, zoning records, and construction ledgers.
