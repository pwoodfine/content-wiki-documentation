**Console OS** is a lightweight, terminal-based operating system designed for the administration of PointSav services and infrastructure. It operates as the primary interface for system administrators and power users, providing direct access to the platform's underlying mechanics.

## Hypervisor Architecture

In the PointSav system, **Console OS** functions as a **Type II Hypervisor**. It typically deploys within a {{gli|Virtual machine}} on a host device, allowing users to run standard desktop operating systems on their local hardware while maintaining a secure, isolated environment for institutional management.

For users requiring a native execution environment, Console OS can also be deployed directly onto {{gli|Bare metal resources}}.

## Operational Interface

Console OS prioritizes stability and efficiency over graphical novelty. The system architecture is built around two primary interaction models:

1.  **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Provides the most granular control for technical configuration, deployment orchestration, and scripting.
2.  **Terminal User Interface (TUI):** Offers a semi-graphical, keyboard-driven environment for routine administrative tasks, such as managing {{gli|Totebox Archive}} states and monitoring system telemetry.

## Record Keeping and the Digital Twin

A critical function of Console OS is providing the secure path to institutional **Record Keeping**. It serves as the gateway to the **Digital Twin**, allowing administrators to remotely control physical assets (such as Woodfine Buildings) and view real-time data from IoT Sensors through an audited, cryptographically verified session.
