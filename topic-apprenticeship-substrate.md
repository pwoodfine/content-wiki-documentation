# The Apprenticeship Substrate

> The Apprenticeship Substrate is the Foundry mechanism that routes code-shaped and editorial work first through a local Small Language Model, captures signed senior verdicts on every attempt, and uses the resulting preference pairs as continued-pretraining signal.

**The Apprenticeship Substrate** is an architecture-layer pattern in the Foundry platform that inverts the conventional human-AI authorship sequence. Rather than having a senior author a diff directly, the Doorman routes the task to the local SLM (`service-slm`) first; the human operator with their senior reviewer assistant becomes the verifier rather than the primary author. The disagreement between apprentice attempt and senior verdict — captured as signed, append-only training tuples — is the highest-quality continued-pretraining signal Foundry produces. This article describes the routing protocol, the brief-attempt-verdict format, the promotion ledger, and what makes this posture structurally inaccessible to hyperscaler-managed AI.

## Overview

Captured observation trains a model on what the senior wrote. Captured interaction — apprentice attempt plus signed senior verdict — trains an order of magnitude more efficiently per tuple. This is the central finding of the RLHF, DPO, and RLAIF literature from 2024–2026: signed preference data is the most valuable training input.

The Apprenticeship Substrate is the routing inversion that produces those interaction tuples on real production work, not synthetic benchmarks. Every Foundry session exercises the apprentice; every signed verdict is a training tuple; every graduated task-type eliminates external AI tokens monotonically.

Four preconditions make this work, and all four hold only inside Foundry-shaped substrates:

1. Per-customer constitutional charter (the Doctrine).
2. Per-customer signing identities (`allowed_signers`).
3. Per-customer task-type granularity (the promotion ledger).
4. Per-customer continued pretraining.

Hyperscalers structurally lack all four.

## Ring and Role

The Apprenticeship Substrate spans Ring 3 — Optional Intelligence and the training-corpus infrastructure. `service-slm` (the Doorman) is the Ring 3 service that executes apprentice routing. The promotion ledger and corpus capture scripts live in the workspace engineering layer. The substrate is active whenever a Foundry session issues a brief rather than authoring directly.

## Architecture

### The three stages

Routing operates per task-type. Promotion is automatic on threshold crossing; demotion is automatic on any post-commit revert traced to an apprentice diff.

| Stage | Routing | Senior review |
|---|---|---|
| `review` | Apprentice attempts; senior reviews every diff before commit | Every diff |
| `spot-check` | Apprentice commits; senior reviews 1-in-N sampled and auto-flagged anomalies | Sampled and flagged |
| `autonomous` | Apprentice commits autonomously; monthly batch audit | Batch audit |

Initial promotion thresholds:

- `review → spot-check`: at least 50 verdicts AND accept-rate at least 0.85 over the rolling 50.
- `spot-check → autonomous`: at least 100 verdicts AND accept-rate at least 0.95 over the rolling 100 AND zero post-commit reverts traced to apprentice diffs.

Demotion: a single revert traced to an apprentice diff drops the task-type one stage. Recorded as a signed event in the ledger. New task-types start at `review`.

### The brief, the attempt, the verdict

A senior who would author a diff issues a **brief** instead. The brief states what is being done, the invariants the diff must preserve, the doctrine clauses cited, and the acceptance test the apprentice should make pass.

The apprentice responds with an **attempt**: chain-of-thought reasoning citing the brief invariants, a self-confidence value calibrated against its prior ledger record on this task-type, and a unified diff. If self-confidence falls below 0.5, the apprentice escalates without diff — surfacing "this task-type is harder than I can handle today" rather than producing a low-confidence diff that wastes senior review.

The senior reads the attempt and signs a **verdict**: `accept`, `refine`, `reject`, or `defer-tier-c`. Verdicts on `refine` and `reject` carry one-sentence notes — these are the highest-signal training data the corpus produces. The signature uses `ssh-keygen -Y sign` with a namespace tag (`apprenticeship-verdict-v1`) that binds the signature to this protocol; a commit-signing signature cannot be repurposed as a verdict signature.

### The promotion ledger

A single plain-text file tracks every task-type's stage and the event log that drives promotion and demotion. Every event line carries an embedded SSH signature block; the writer (the Doorman) appends only after verifying the senior's signature on the verdict batch. Single-writer concurrency via `flock(2)`; acceptable latency at the expected verdict rate of tens per day.

Event types: `task-type-add`, `verdict-batch`, `promotion`, `demotion`, `verdict-supersession`, `task-type-retire`. The schema is closed; new event types require ledger discipline because promotion threshold computations depend on them.

### Production routing vs shadow routing

Two paths run in parallel.

**Production routing** runs on graduated task-types. The senior issues a brief before authoring the diff; the apprentice's attempt is the candidate diff; on `accept`, the apprentice's diff lands in the commit. This eliminates senior authoring tokens on graduated task-types.

**Shadow routing** runs on every other code-shaped commit across every active cluster. After the diff is authored the existing way, the session fires a brief to the apprentice; the apprentice produces what it would have done; the (brief, attempt, actual-diff) triple is captured to the corpus as a training tuple. No verdict; no signing. The apprentice is exercised continuously; the corpus grows on every cluster's work.

Production routing eliminates senior tokens on graduated types. Shadow routing generates the training data that graduates the next type. The two paths compound.

### Capture pipeline

The apprenticeship corpus is a fourth corpus alongside the constitutional, engineering, and tenant-runtime corpora. Per-tenant partitioning lives at the directory level:

```
~/Foundry/data/training-corpus/apprenticeship/<task-type>/<tenant>/<ulid>.jsonl
```

One file per (brief, attempt, verdict) triple. Tenant-private records never leave the tenant's substrate per Doctrine §IV.b.

A `refine` or `reject` verdict additionally produces a Direct Preference Optimisation triple: (rejected attempt, corrected diff, doctrine-violation tag). DPO triples feed adapter training on the apprentice's policy.

## Configuration

The first registered task-type is `version-bump-manifest`. Every workspace MINOR and PATCH bump touches `MANIFEST.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. Well-shaped, no architectural judgment required, easily verifiable. The apprentice graduates this type first; senior tokens drop on this class of work; the next task-type registers.

The end state is a continuum — code-shaped work the apprentice handles autonomously, code-shaped work the apprentice handles with spot-check, code-shaped work that still requires senior review. The continuum shifts as the corpus matures.

Per `[ni-51-102]` continuous-disclosure language, the trajectory toward token-elimination across graduated task-types is forward-looking. The shape is in place; the operational throughput matures as the corpus grows and task-types graduate.
