## Platform areas

**Architecture**
Design principles, substrate patterns, and cross-cutting invariants that
govern how the platform is built. Covers the three-ring stack, compounding
substrate, AI routing, cryptographic audit, and the editorial pipeline.
→ [Browse architecture](/architecture/)

**Services**
Autonomous services implementing Ring 1 and Ring 2 of the three-ring
architecture: ingest, processing, search, egress, and the linguistic
air-lock.
→ [Browse services](/services/)

**Systems**
The operating systems at the foundation layer: ToteboxOS and its
seL4-based capability model, orchestration, and tenant isolation.
→ [Browse systems](/systems/)

**Applications**
User-facing and internal applications built on the platform substrate,
including the wiki engine that serves this site.
→ [Browse applications](/applications/)

**Governance**
Architecture decision records, licensing posture, contributor model,
and compliance conventions.
→ [Browse governance](/governance/)

**Infrastructure**
Fleet deployment, cloud topology, and operational runtime.
In preparation — articles are planned for this category.
→ [Browse infrastructure](/infrastructure/)

**Company**
<!-- BCSC: no forward-looking statements in the category description;
     company/ articles carry their own FLI labels per Rule 1 -->
Corporate entities, organisational structure, and public disclosures.
→ [Browse company](/company/)

**Reference**
Glossary, nomenclature matrix, and style guides for contributors across
all audiences.
→ [Browse reference](/reference/)

**Help**
Onboarding guides for engineers, writers, and designers contributing to
the platform and its documentation.
→ [Browse help](/help/)

## Featured article

<!-- ENGINE: read the file `featured-topic.yaml` from the repo root.
     Parse the pinned slug. Fetch that article's title and first
     paragraph. Render as a framed panel with the title, lead
     paragraph, and a "Read more →" link. If the pin file is absent,
     suppress this section entirely — do not render an empty frame.
     featured-topic.yaml schema: slug: (required), since: (optional
     YYYY-MM-DD), note: (optional one-liner; engine ignores). -->

[[compounding-substrate]] — The Compounding Substrate describes how
PointSav's platform is designed so that each capability a customer installs
makes the next capability easier to operate. The substrate pattern is the
design philosophy behind the three-ring architecture and the leapfrog-2030
trajectory.

## Recent additions

<!-- ENGINE: sort all article files by last_edited: frontmatter date
     descending (fall back to git commit date if last_edited: is
     absent). Render the top 5 as an unordered list:
     "- [Title](/category/slug) — YYYY-MM-DD"
     If fewer than 5 articles exist, render however many there are.
     Do not render this section if the article count is 0.
     Per Q5.A operator ratification: dated-announcement TOPICs
     (filename pattern `topic-*-YYYY-MM-DD.md`) route here rather than
     to permanent category articles. -->
