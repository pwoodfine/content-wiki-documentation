## Services

This category covers the autonomous services that implement Ring 1 and Ring 2 of the three-ring architecture. Ring 1 services handle per-tenant boundary ingest — each one implements a Model Context Protocol server interface, the standard by which external systems connect to the platform. Ring 2 services provide deterministic knowledge and processing: extraction, content management, search, and egress. The platform functions fully across both rings without AI compute.

Each article describes one service: its purpose, its position in the ring structure, the API contract it presents, and the data it owns. Articles are written for engineers integrating with or extending a service, and for architects evaluating how the platform composes.

`service-slm` is the single boundary between Ring 2 and Ring 3 — the Doorman that routes AI requests among three compute tiers and holds all API keys. Its article describes the routing logic and the audit surface it produces.

     root-prefixed TOPICs into this category subdirectory. Until
     migration lands, the existing root TOPICs render at their current
     URLs (topic-<slug>.md); this landing references them by current slug. -->
