## Architecture

This category covers the design principles, substrate patterns, and cross-cutting invariants that govern how the PointSav platform is built. Architecture articles describe the logical structure of the system — how rings compose, how properties compound across deployments, how editorial and AI-routing layers are coordinated, and why the design choices are durable at the scale of a decade.

The platform is organised around a three-ring stack: Ring 1 handles per-tenant boundary ingest, Ring 2 provides deterministic knowledge and processing, and Ring 3 adds optional AI inference. Architecture articles explain what each ring does, how they interoperate, and the invariants that must hold across all three. Articles in this category are written for engineers and technical readers who need to understand the platform at depth before building on it or extending it.

<!-- EDITORIAL NOTE: PL.7 chunked normalization sweep will migrate
     root-prefixed TOPICs into this category subdirectory. Until
     migration lands, the existing root TOPICs render at their current
     URLs (topic-<slug>.md); this landing references them by current slug. -->
