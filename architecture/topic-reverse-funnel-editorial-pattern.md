# Reverse-Funnel Editorial Pattern

> The Reverse-Funnel Editorial Pattern is a publishing discipline in which multiple cluster Tasks produce bulk technical drafts, a single editorial gateway refines them to production register, and Creative Contributors edit the published output — generating preference data that trains the per-tenant substrate over time.

The substrate inverts the conventional editorial cycle. Most publishing pipelines put the Creative at the start of the loop: draft the manuscript, hand to copy-editor, ship to readers. The **Reverse-Funnel Editorial Pattern** puts the Creative at the end of the loop. Cluster Tasks ship rough drafts forward to a single editorial gateway; the gateway refines to register; the refined version goes live; Creative Contributors edit the published file; their edits feed the next training cycle as preference data. This is the inversion that lets a small Creative team scale to a substrate the size of Wikipedia.

## Definition

The Reverse-Funnel Editorial Pattern is a publishing discipline where:

1. Multiple originating clusters produce **bulk drafts** — technically accurate, freely-cited, rough register.
2. A single editorial gateway (`service-language`, the project-language cluster) refines every draft to production register: banned-vocabulary enforcement, BCSC continuous-disclosure posture, bilingual pair generation, citation registry resolution.
3. The refined version publishes immediately to the destination repo.
4. Creative Contributors enter at the end — they edit the published file. Their edits become the second leg of a preference pair.
5. Quarterly continued pretraining on the corpus of (raw, refined, creative-edited) tuples produces a substrate baseline that drifts closer to the Creative over time.

The pattern is the inverse of standard editorial workflow. Standard: human writes, machine assists. Reverse-funnel: machine drafts, human refines, both signals train the substrate.

## How the substrate operates

The substrate runs three input ports:

- Cluster Task drafts at `~/Foundry/clones/<cluster>/.claude/drafts-outbound/`
- Root drafts at `<repo>/.claude/drafts-outbound/`
- Master drafts at `~/Foundry/.claude/drafts-outbound/`

`bin/draft-sweep.sh` walks all three at session start; project-language picks up `state: draft-pending-language-pass` items in priority order. Each draft carries `foundry-draft-v1` frontmatter declaring originating cluster, target repo, audience, BCSC class, language protocol, and `notes_for_editor`. The draft body is bulk — references inline as URLs, repetition allowed, register discipline not enforced. project-language enforces.

Refinement applies four disciplines deterministically:

1. **Banned-vocabulary grammar** — Lark EBNF declares forbidden editorial terms; `validate.py` (Phase 1B) and decode-time enforcement via `[llguidance]` (AS-2 pending) make violations grammatically impossible.
2. **BCSC continuous-disclosure posture** — forward-looking claims carry planned / intended / may language, cautionary framing, and reasonable-basis blocks per `[ni-51-102]`.
3. **Citation registry resolution** — inline URLs in the bulk become `[citation-id]` references resolved against `~/Foundry/citations.yaml`.
4. **Bilingual pair generation** — Spanish strategic adaptation per DOCTRINE.md §XII (overview, not 1:1 translation).

Refined output hands off to the destination repo via the standard `handoffs-outbound.md` mechanism. Three JSONL events emit to the apprenticeship corpus: `draft-created` (originator), `draft-refined` (project-language), `creative-edited` (originator after publish plus Creative edit).

## Why hyperscaler-managed AI cannot replicate

Three structural reasons.

**Per-tenant SLM continued-pretraining is structurally absent.** Multi-tenant SaaS LLMs run a single editorial regime across all customers. A Creative's edits in one tenant cannot feed an SLM that personalises responses for that tenant only — the model is shared. The Reverse-Funnel pattern's compounding loop closes only when the SLM has tenant-private adapters and a tenant-private training corpus.

**Per-tenant editorial-floor adapters are structurally absent.** Banned-vocabulary grammars, BCSC discipline templates, and language-protocol adapters are tenant-specific. Hyperscaler products expose neither grammar composition nor adapter-composition primitives. Tenants get structured-output modes, not a tenant grammar loaded at inference time.

**The closed loop demands tenant-private training data.** Even if a hyperscaler captured Creative edits, the resulting training data feeds a tenant-neutral or vendor-specific model. Tenants cannot own a model that becomes literate in their own voice. The compounding loop demands the training-data sovereignty `[constitutional-ai-2212-08073]` that the multi-tenant LLM business model structurally cannot grant.

## What this enables in Foundry

The Compounding Substrate's editorial path closes a continued-pretraining loop on craft, not just structure:

- The apprenticeship-substrate (Doctrine claim #32) closes the loop on **structural correctness** — apprentice diff, senior verdict, Stage-1 DPO pair.
- The Reverse-Funnel pattern closes the loop on **editorial craft** — refined draft, creative-edited, Stage-2 DPO pair.
- Both stages feed the same OLMo `[olmo3-allenai]` continued-pretraining corpus.

After enough cycles, the substrate produces draft baselines at 80%, then 90%, then 95% of Creative's craft level. Creative load drops over time; their scope expands. They move upstream to brand strategy, architectural framing, and novel-form authorship — work the substrate cannot reach yet.

## Three-Tier Contributor Model — explicit mapping

The Three-Tier Contributor Model (Core / Paid / Open) maps onto the cycle position:

- **Core** (4–7 operators): operate the substrate, cluster Tasks, and doctrine throughout the cycle.
- **Paid** (50–100 Creative Contributors): edit the published refined version at the end of the cycle — craft, brand, and voice.
- **Open** (10,000-plus wiki consumers): consume, cite, and fork outside the cycle.

Paid contributors in this pattern are not tech writers. They are craft specialists — designers, narrative editors, brand-voice contributors. The substrate-generated draft supplies the technical floor; the Creative's job is to raise the ceiling.

## Operational implications

Recruitment shifts. Because the substrate-generated draft already carries accurate technical content, Paid-tier contributors do not require deep engineering background. The hiring profile shifts toward craft discipline: narrative specialists, brand-voice editors, illustration contributors.

Quality control simplifies. The substrate floor is verifiable mechanically — banned-vocabulary violations are caught before publication; BCSC posture is enforced by grammar, not by auditor. Human quality control focuses on brand alignment, narrative coherence, and graphics rendering.

Per-tenant voice distils into per-tenant adapters. As creative-edited preference pairs accumulate on a given tenant's namespace, the tenant adapter learns the tenant's voice. Subsequent drafts on that namespace arrive closer to the tenant's established baseline without additional human instruction. This is Adapter Composition Algebra (Doctrine claim #22) applied to the editorial layer.

## Forward-looking — pending substrate work

Per `[ni-51-102]` and `[osc-sn-51-721]` continuous-disclosure language, the trajectory below is planned and intended. Material assumptions include continued availability of OLMo open-weight models under Apache 2.0 licensing, sufficient Creative-edited corpus volume to support meaningful continued pretraining, and uninterrupted operation of the project-language editorial gateway. Actual outcomes may differ.

- AS-2 (project-slm Task) intends to integrate `[llguidance]` into the Doorman so vLLM Tier B accepts structured output grammars. service-language is the planned primary consumer.
- Per-tenant Creative-voice adapters are intended to distil from accumulated Stage-2 DPO pairs over the first year of operation.
- The Stage-1 plus Stage-2 OLMo continued-pretraining run targets a quarterly cadence.
- Creative-tier recruitment is planned to begin after the first batch of refined TOPICs publishes; the first cycles are operator-edited as bootstrapping data.
