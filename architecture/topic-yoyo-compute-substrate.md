The Yo-Yo Compute Substrate is the specification for how `service-slm` manages GPU inference across teardowns. A GPU inference node is expensive at idle. But a node that discards all state on shutdown forces a full re-computation on the next spin-up — slow, wasteful, and commercially corrosive at scale. The Yo-Yo substrate resolves this by decomposing compute state into three rings, each with a different persistence strategy, so that spin-up is fast, state is retained where it is worth retaining, and every event is recorded in a SOC 3-grade audit ledger.

The name is literal: the compute tier comes down and goes back up, repeatedly, without losing what matters.

## The three-ring memory model

| Ring | Name | Storage | Survives teardown? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bootstrap | Container image + GCS-cached model weights | Yes (as artefacts in cold storage) |
| 2 | Working memory (KV cache) | LMCache + Mooncake Store | Yes (pooled, `moduleId`-isolated) |
| 3a | Long-term graph memory | LadybugDB in `service-content` | Yes (authoritative) |
| 3b | Long-term skill (adapters) | LoRA adapter stack as OCI Artefacts | Yes (portable, signed) |

Everything outside these rings is ephemeral and intentionally discarded.

## Ring 1 — Bootstrap: sub-thirty-second warm starts at zero idle cost

The standard trade-off presented by managed GPU services is a false binary: pay continuously for a warm endpoint, or accept sixty-to-one-hundred-twenty-second cold starts for a fully serverless one. Neither is correct for a workload pattern that is bursty but predictable — weekly batch runs plus opportunistic query-time calls.

The Yo-Yo substrate resolves this through four pre-staged bootstrap layers:

1. **Pre-built container image** in a regional artefact registry. The image contains the inference runtime plus configuration. Pull time from a regional mirror is approximately five to ten seconds.
2. **Pre-downloaded model weights** in cloud object storage. Mounting from cold storage avoids re-downloading tens of gigabytes from the upstream model repository on every cycle.
3. **Cloud Run GPU with drivers pre-installed**. Per Google's April 2026 documentation, GPU instances with drivers already available start in approximately five seconds. Driver installation is not on the critical path.
4. **Warm pool as an opt-in, not a default**. `min-instances=1` is activated only during a declared sustained-load window — an overnight full-corpus run, for example — then switched off. Idle billing applies only during that window.

The combined result is a worst-case warm-start of approximately fifteen seconds at zero idle cost in normal operation.

When CUDA checkpoint/restore reaches production maturity (currently at RFC stage as of early 2026, with demonstrated ten-times cold-start improvement in controlled environments), Ring 1 is designed to accept a checkpoint bundle as an optional bootstrap input. That is a configuration change, not an architectural rewrite.

## Ring 2 — Working memory: KV cache that survives teardown

When a GPU node tears down, the in-GPU KV cache is lost. On the next spin-up, the inference engine re-prefills every prompt from scratch — even when ninety percent of the input (the graph subgraph, the system prompt, the task classification context) is identical to what was just processed. This is the dominant cause of "the second run feels slow."

**LMCache** integrates with the inference engine via the KV connector interface. It hashes token blocks and fetches matching KV cache blocks from a tiered store: GPU memory → CPU DRAM → remote object storage. **Mooncake Store** is the remote storage tier — a distributed KV pool that persists in CPU DRAM on persistent hosts or in SSD-backed object storage. It survives inference engine instance teardown because it runs as a separate process.

The `moduleId` field from the RF2 envelope namespaces every cache block. Customer A's blocks never collide with Customer B's, even when both draw from the same physical pool. The Mooncake master instance is a small, always-on host — provisioned once, not per-project.

For workloads with repeated-prefix structure — every document processed against the same knowledge graph shares a multi-thousand-token system prompt and context spine — cache hit rates above sixty percent are achievable on the second full corpus run. At scale this translates directly into GPU cost reduction.

## Ring 3a — Long-term graph memory

The LadybugDB knowledge graph in `service-content` is the long-term semantic memory for every project. `service-slm` reads from it at context-assembly time. It never writes back directly; all writes flow through the validated delta-application path after the sanitise / compute / rehydrate cycle completes.

Ring 3a is project-scoped by design. One tenant's graph partition is inaccessible to another without an explicit export through the authorised data channel. This is the correct behaviour for data. It is the wrong behaviour for skill — which is why Ring 3b exists as a separate layer.

## Ring 3b — Long-term skill: the LoRA adapter library

This is the compounding layer. Each new project leaves behind a fine-tuned LoRA adapter — a small, versioned, frozen-weight module that encodes task-specific behaviour. A adapter trained on classification patterns, entity resolution, or domain terminology runs on top of the base model weights at near-base inference speed.

Adapters are stored as OCI Artefacts, Sigstore-signed and SLSA-attested. They are loaded at inference engine boot:

- **Shared adapters** (prefixed `dka-*`) accumulate cross-project general-domain skill. Every project benefits when these improve.
- **Per-project adapters** (prefixed `{client}-*`) carry project-specific entity and terminology knowledge. They stay with their project.

The dual-adapter pattern (shared + per-project, with orthogonality constraints to prevent catastrophic forgetting) is the recommended starting configuration. Migration to a single routed adapter becomes worthwhile when the adapter library grows beyond approximately ten projects and management overhead increases.

Every adapter version is registered in `service-slm/memory/adapters/registry.yaml` before activation, with a training-data hash and evaluator sign-off. Adapter selection at query time is automatic: the `moduleId` plus the task classification determine which adapter stack activates.

**This is the compounding asset.** The base model is a commodity that every deployment in the industry can access. The adapter library is specific to the operator's accumulated operational history. It grows with every project. It cannot be purchased from a third party.

## The audit ledger

Every Yo-Yo event is logged to an append-only CSV ledger. The schema records event type, `moduleId`, node identifier, job identifier, input hash, adapter versions active, KV cache hit ratio, tokens processed, GPU seconds consumed, estimated cost, completion status, and operator identity.

Event types include `BOOT_REQUEST`, `BOOT_COMPLETE`, `JOB_START`, `JOB_COMPLETE`, `CHECKPOINT`, `TEARDOWN_REQUEST`, `TEARDOWN_COMPLETE`, `PREEMPTION`, `ADAPTER_LOAD`, and `KV_POOL_SYNC`.

This ledger is a processing-integrity artefact. An operator who needs to answer "which adapter weighed in on this output, and what did it cost?" can inspect the ledger directly, without querying a third-party system. The ledger links every output — every wiki page, every exported data record, every generated analysis — back to the exact compute event, the exact adapter versions, and the exact source material that produced it.

Managed inference endpoints structurally cannot produce this record. They operate at a layer above the events the Yo-Yo ledger captures, and they have no incentive to expose per-call cost decomposition or adapter provenance.

## The `moduleId` discipline

The RF2 envelope already carries a `moduleId` field on every message. The Yo-Yo substrate extends its reach into compute:

- **Ring 1**: selects the container variant to boot (rarely varies per project)
- **Ring 2**: namespaces Mooncake block hashes (Project A and Project B share a pool; they never share cache blocks)
- **Ring 3a**: scopes the LadybugDB graph traversal to the correct partition
- **Ring 3b**: selects the LoRA adapter stack to activate
- **Ledger**: tags every entry for per-project cost accounting

One field, five jobs. The multi-tenant isolation property was not an afterthought; it is a structural consequence of `moduleId` propagating through every ring.

## 2030 headroom

The substrate is designed so research primitives that are planned or at RFC stage in 2026 can be integrated without architectural change:

| Primitive | Status (2026) | Integration point |
|---|---|---|
| CUDA checkpoint/restore | RFC stage; ten-times cold-start gain demonstrated in controlled settings | Ring 1: optional checkpoint bundle input |
| Single routed adapter (C-LoRA) | Published 2025 | Ring 3b: registry schema migration |
| Multi-cloud KV pool | Multi-cloud pool support planned in SkyPilot 0.11+ | Ring 2: Mooncake master on multi-cloud pool |
| FP8 KV cache quantisation | Available as inference engine config flag | Ring 2: config flag, approximately two-times memory reduction |
| Sleep-time adapter retraining | Research stage | Ring 3b: nightly batch retraining on reduced-cost compute |

Each of these may integrate as a configuration addition or new subdirectory. None requires rewriting `service-slm`.

## Phase roadmap

**Phase 1 (current — trial)**: Ring 1 fully built (bootstrap, Cloud Run GPU, SkyPilot). Ledger fully built with all event types defined. `moduleId` propagated through every call even with only one project active. Rings 2 and 3b are not yet needed and are intentionally deferred.

**Phase 2 (planned — after trial)**: Ring 2 added. LMCache and Mooncake Store integrated. Target: sixty percent or greater cache hit rate on the second full corpus run.

**Phase 3 (planned — first commercial deployment beyond initial customer)**: Ring 3b added. First LoRA adapters trained (task classification, archetype detection, entity resolution). Dual-adapter pattern, adapter registry, training pipeline.

**Phase 4 (intended — when research matures)**: CUDA checkpoint/restore integration. Single-adapter C-LoRA migration. Multi-cloud KV pool.
