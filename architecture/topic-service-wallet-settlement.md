`service-wallet` (Ring 2) is the per-tenant internal accounting ledger that records and settles all reverse-flow revenue from the data marketplace and ad exchange.

This is Doctrine claim #53.[^1]

## What service-wallet is (and is not)

`service-wallet` is an **accounting ledger**, not a payment rail and not a custodial wallet. The distinction matters legally and structurally:

- **Accounting ledger**: records credits, debits, and fees as signed JSONL entries; denominated in the operator's chosen unit of account; no funds in transit; Foundry holds no float
- **Not a payment rail**: Foundry does not route money between parties; the buyer's transaction goes directly to the destination address or through the smart contract; Foundry's fee is an accounting deduction at the time the incoming credit is recorded
- **Not a custodial wallet**: Foundry never holds the tenant's private keys; the tenant's balance in `service-wallet` is an accounting balance representing amounts owed, not a pool of funds under Foundry's control

This architecture keeps Foundry structurally outside regulated money-transmitter and custodial-wallet territory. Tenants should obtain local legal counsel on their own payment activities; this is directional, not legal advice.

## Ledger entry schema

Every credit, debit, and fee entry is a signed JSONL record:

```json
{
  "schema": "foundry-wallet-entry-v1",
  "entry_id": "<ulid>",
  "tenant_id": "<module_id>",
  "type": "credit | debit | fee_deduction | withdrawal",
  "amount": "<decimal string>",
  "currency": "USDC | USD | CAD | <operator-configured>",
  "chain": "polygon-pos | solana | fiat | null",
  "tx_hash": "<on-chain tx hash if applicable>",
  "source_service": "service-market | service-exchange",
  "platform_fee_pct": "<decimal string>",
  "platform_fee_amount": "<decimal string>",
  "net_tenant_amount": "<decimal string>",
  "signed_at": "<ISO 8601>",
  "ledger_seq": "<monotonic integer>"
}
```

The `platform_fee_amount` is deducted at credit time. The tenant's balance is `net_tenant_amount` accumulated across credits minus debits.

## Settlement flow

```
1. Revenue event occurs (data purchase or ad impression/win)
2. Incoming credit recorded in service-wallet ledger
   Platform fee deducted at this step (accounting deduction)
3. Tenant's net balance increases
4. Tenant initiates withdrawal (tenant-controlled; not automatic)
   Options:
   (a) Crypto withdrawal → tenant's pre-registered address (EVM or Solana)
   (b) Fiat withdrawal → tenant's bank account (via Stripe Connect or equivalent)
   (c) Tier B credit → balance reinvested as Yo-Yo compute budget
5. Withdrawal event recorded in ledger
   Receipt anchored to Sigstore Rekor
   WORM ledger entry in service-fs closes the accounting cycle
```

## Payment rails for crypto withdrawals

| Chain | Typical fee | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Polygon PoS | approximately $0.002/tx | Primary — lowest fees, proven micropayment volume |
| Solana | approximately $0.0005/tx | Secondary — fastest settlement, sub-cent fees |

Non-custodial: platform stores destination addresses (public keys only). The withdrawal transaction is signed by the tenant's wallet, not by Foundry. Platform cannot move funds without the tenant's signature.

Circle Paymaster handles gas abstraction — tenants pay gas in USDC; no native Polygon/Solana token required for SMB operators.

## Platform fee

The platform fee percentage is an operator configuration at deployment time, applied uniformly across all reverse-flow transactions for that tenant. It is an accounting deduction, not a separate transaction. The specific percentage is an open operator decision.

Industry reference: direct-payment-to-rights-holder models at scale validate that customers keeping a majority of revenue is a workable commercial structure. Foundry's split is an operator configuration; the intended default is "customer keeps majority."

## Anchor and audit

Every withdrawal receipt is anchored to Sigstore Rekor. The anchor record includes: tenant ID, ledger sequence at withdrawal, amount, chain, and transaction hash. This provides a tamper-evident external timestamp suitable for accounting and legal purposes.

The full ledger history is queryable by the tenant at any time. The export format is JSONL — the same format as the ingestion record. Portability is unconditional; the ledger travels with the tenant on exit per claim #48.[^3]
