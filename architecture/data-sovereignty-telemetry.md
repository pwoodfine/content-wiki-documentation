PointSav digital systems are engineered for absolute data sovereignty, utilizing a "Zero-State" architecture that eliminates the collection of personally identifiable information (PII). By prioritizing DARP compliance (Data Archive Retrieval Protocol), Foundry ensures that platform metrics never compromise the privacy of the asset holder or the individual user.

## 1. Cookieless Infrastructure

Foundry strictly prohibits the use of tracking cookies, persistent local storage tracking, and third-party analytics integrations. This posture eliminates the legal requirement for intrusive cookie consent banners, providing a cleaner and more focused user experience.

## 2. Geospatial Anonymization Protocol

Operational metrics are gathered exclusively through a First-Party Ping Architecture. This system converts network metadata into anonymized geospatial data without retaining PII:

*   **Mandatory IP Masking:** The ingestion server instantly drops the final octet of the incoming IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.45` becomes `192.168.1.0`).
*   **Anonymized Auditing:** Interaction data—such as document downloads—is used strictly to map deal velocity and platform friction, ensuring compliance while maintaining infrastructure security.

## 3. Mandatory Regulatory Disclosure

All public-facing interfaces are required to append the following disclosure to their legal blocks:

> *"Digital Infrastructure & Privacy Posture: This interface operates on a Zero-Execution and Zero-State Telemetry architecture. It does not deploy tracking cookies, retain session states, or harvest Personally Identifiable Information (PII). System interactions are limited to the collection of anonymized, masked network routing data strictly for the purpose of auditing infrastructure security and verifying document access."*

This commitment ensures that Foundry remains the benchmark for privacy-first institutional infrastructure.
