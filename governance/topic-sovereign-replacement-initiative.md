# Sovereign Replacement Initiative

> The Sovereign Replacement Initiative is the formal program that records every foreign dependency in a structured ledger, enforces quarantine isolation until a native replacement is ready, and retires the dependency once the replacement reaches structural parity.

Any platform that has passed through a digital-transformation
phase inherits third-party architectural components it did not
design. Reliance on those components — proprietary cloud
authentication providers, foreign GPU drivers, commercial graph
APIs — creates a structural risk: if a third-party vendor changes
its terms of service or deprecates an API, the dependent platform
either adapts under pressure or halts. The **Sovereign Replacement
Initiative** is the Foundry response to this class of risk. It is
a physical ledger of outstanding third-party dependencies and an
active engineering pipeline designed to eliminate them
systematically.

## Technical debt ledger

The initiative maintains a ledger that records each identified
third-party dependency alongside its isolation status and the
corresponding moonshot initiative, if one has been opened. The
ledger is a live document: entries are added when new dependencies
are identified and closed when a native replacement achieves
structural parity. Auditors and contributors can read the ledger
to see the platform's current external exposure.

## Quarantine protocol

Until a native replacement is available, a legacy component is
physically isolated into a quarantined component silo (for example,
`vendor-azure-auth` or `vendor-microsoft-graph`). These directories
are structural containers that restrict the foreign code to a
controlled capability boundary. The isolation prevents coupling from
spreading into adjacent platform layers while the replacement is
under development.

## Moonshot pipeline

For every quarantined dependency, the engineering team opens a
corresponding moonshot directory (for example, `moonshot-database`
or `moonshot-kernel`). These are active development efforts
targeting native, formally verifiable implementations. Once a
moonshot component achieves structural parity with its quarantined
counterpart, it replaces the isolated directory and the ledger
entry closes.

## Vendor and customer roles

The initiative operates across the vendor-customer structure:

- **Vendor (PointSav Digital Systems).** Maintains the ledger,
  engineers the native replacements, and owns the moonshot
  directories.
- **Customer (Woodfine Management Corp.).** Audits the pipeline to
  verify progress toward operational independence from legacy
  external providers.
