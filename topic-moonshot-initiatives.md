# Moonshot Initiatives

> Moonshot initiatives are long-running engineering programs that replace quarantined third-party dependencies with internally built, formally verifiable equivalents — reducing vendor lock-in and shrinking the platform's external attack surface.

The Foundry platform actively tracks third-party engineering debt in
a structured ledger. Foreign architectural components are contained
in isolated directories, called quarantined component silos, until
a **moonshot initiative** delivers a native replacement. The
[[topic-sovereign-replacement-initiative|Sovereign Replacement Initiative]]
is the governance program that coordinates these efforts. Each
moonshot initiative is a distinct engineering effort targeting one
dependency class; completion is defined as structural parity with
the component it replaces, at which point the native implementation
physically supersedes the quarantined directory.

## Technical debt tracking

The ledger records every identified foreign dependency alongside its
isolation status and the associated moonshot initiative, if one has
been opened. Entries remain active until replacement is confirmed.
This gives auditors and contributors a live picture of the
platform's outstanding external exposure.

## Quarantine protocol

Until a legacy component can be replaced, it is physically isolated
into a quarantined component silo (for example, `vendor-azure-auth`
or `vendor-microsoft-graph`). These directories act as structural
boundaries. The foreign code may not execute outside a tightly
controlled capability sandbox. Isolation prevents a dependency from
spreading coupling into adjacent platform layers.

## Replacement pipeline

For every quarantined dependency, the engineering team opens a
corresponding moonshot directory (for example, `moonshot-database`
or `moonshot-kernel`). Work in these directories targets native,
formally verified implementations in Rust. Once a moonshot component
reaches structural parity with its quarantined counterpart, it
replaces the isolated directory. The ledger entry closes at that
point.

## Vendor and customer roles

- The Vendor (PointSav Digital Systems) maintains the moonshot
  ledgers and engineers the native replacements.
- The Customer (Woodfine Management Corp.) audits the pipeline to
  verify progress toward operational independence.
