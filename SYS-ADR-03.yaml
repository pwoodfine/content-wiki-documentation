title: Silicon-Pinned ISO Architecture
tier: Tier-4-OS
category: Infrastructure-Provisioning
tags: [adr, iso, silicon-pinned, determinism, drivers]
abstract: |
  Decision record to compile strict Silicon-Pinned ISOs for bare-metal nodes,
  eliminating generic driver bloat and ensuring absolute determinism.
details:
  os_infrastructure:
    target: Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 / Broadcom BCM4322 (Node 1 - Muscle).
  os_network_admin:
    target: Intel i5-2400S / Broadcom BCM57765 (Node 3 - Brain).
  consequences:
    advantage: Zero driver bloat. Tuned to exact memory boundaries.
    limitation: ISOs kernel-panic if booted on unauthorized silicon.
    future_proofing: Re-compilation via updated system-substrate profiles.
