abstract: |
  Physical/virtual mesh for scaling a Totebox Orchestration.
  Acts as a lightweight, stateless hypervisor on any hardware, decoupling 
  the Logic from the Metal via the system-network-interface adapter.
details:
  mesh_topology:
    node_1_muscle: Laptop B. Bare-metal os-infrastructure executing heavy payload VMs.
    node_2_relay: Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Virtualized os-infrastructure on e2-micro. Acts as the static IP anchor.
    node_3_brain: iMac 12.1. Virtualized os-network-admin (KVM) managing cryptographic capabilities.
  vertical_adapter_spine:
    concept: The system-network-interface abstracts the physical metal.
    routing: OS engines talk to the interface; the interface routes to either vendor-virtio (VMs) or system-substrate (Bare-metal).
